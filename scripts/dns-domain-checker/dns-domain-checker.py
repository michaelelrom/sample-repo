DNS Domain Checker

A script designed for network automation and process orchestration.
Validates DNS record existence for a given hostname, making it ideal for pre-deployment automation,
service dependency validation, and multi-stage orchestration workflows.

Automation use cases:
- Pre-deployment: Verify DNS dependencies in automated provisioning processes
- Network orchestration: Confirm DNS propagation after infrastructure changes
- Service validation: Verify critical services are properly registered within workflows

Output format:
- Text: Human-readable output for operations teams

Exit codes:
  0 - Success (record found or not found, check output for details)
  1 - Error occurred (initiate exception handling in automation platform)

Usage: python dns-domain-checker.py --hostname HOSTNAME

# Orchestration Integration Notes:
# ---------------------------
# This script is designed as a building block for complex process orchestration.
#
# Process Integration Points:
#   - Service provisioning: Validate DNS dependencies before resource allocation
#   - Configuration automation: Verify network changes have propagated correctly
#   - End-to-end workflows: Provide decision points for multi-system orchestration
#
# Orchestration Capabilities:
#   - Use the --output json flag for integration with automation platforms
#   - Leverage exit codes for process flow control and dynamic branching
#   - Error code separation enables automated exception handling and recovery
#   - Designed for seamless integration in multi-stage automation sequences

    Validate DNS record existence as a critical step in orchestrated processes.
    
    This function serves as a validation checkpoint in complex automation workflows,
    providing go/no-go decision points for multi-stage orchestration sequences.
    It enables automated verification of network dependencies in end-to-end
    service provisioning and configuration management processes.
    
    Args:
        hostname (str): The hostname to verify in DNS - can include subdomains
                        and should follow RFC 1123 format. Can be dynamically
                        generated as part of automated provisioning processes.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (exists, ip_address) where:
               - exists: Boolean flag for orchestration decision points
               - ip_address: Resolved IP address for automated inventory updates
                 and downstream configuration processes. None if resolution failed.
                
    Orchestration Use Cases:
        - Automated dependency verification in service provisioning
        - Configuration validation in multi-system automation
        - Process branching in end-to-end service orchestration
